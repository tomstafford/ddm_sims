# Intro

## Speed accuracy trade offs
 * ubiquity, must be reckoned with
 * existing solutions suboptimal
  * **TK** other SATO literature

## Low power
 * cost of collecting participants (effort, time, fatigue/quality, money)
 * senstivity of measures
 
## Decision models 
 * Introduction: Ratcliff 1978 etc
 * Principled reconcilation of speed and accuracy
 * demonstrable gains (information theoretic)
 
## Statement of aim
* Not a theoretical innovation, work of translation
  
# Methods
  
## Decision modelling
* Simulation, not analysis 
* Use of HDDM 
	* equivalence of decision models
	
## Logic of simulations
* Considering group difference
* Which have to pick a particular parameter regime
	* n trials, particular values of drift and boundary etc
	* Visualising the SATO as an illustration 
* Effect sizes in drift and boundary
* Null and true effects, hits, FAs, d'

## Implementation
* Parallisation / RSE
* Check in other models (fast-ddm)

# Results

## No Sato
* example participants for set power
* example power gains for set participants

## Sato

# Disucssion
    
## Why accuracy better than RT
* TK other reports that accuracy tracks drift?

## Future work?
* TK link to Shiny app

## Conclusion
* Power gain / participant saving
* Avoid sato induced false positives
	* cite Pirrone et al (2017)
* Other benefits of DDM modelling (componet inspection etc)
