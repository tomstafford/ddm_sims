Across diverse subfields experimentalists collect reaction time and accuracy data. Inter-subject and inter-group speed-accuracy trade-offs (SATOs) are a well-known possibility which are often inadequately addressed. Many experiments focus on a single variable (e.g. psychophysics paradigms analysing accuracy alone), or involve a post-hoc analytic correction (e.g. dividing accuracy by reaction time). Models of decision making, such as the drift diffusion model (DDM), provide a principled account of the decision making process, allowing the recovery of SATO-unconfounded parameters from observed variables. For plausible parameters of a typical between-groups experiment we simulate  experimental data, for both real and null group differences, and for both systematic and null SATOs, and fit the DDM. This exercise allows us to make a number of concrete recommendations for experimentalists: we show, in terms of reduction of required sample size, how decision modelling allows more efficient data collection for set statistical power; we confirm and depict the non-linear speed-accuracy relation; we show how much more sensitive accuracy is as a measure than reaction time.
